Say you’re a geography teacher with 35 students in your class and you want 
to give a pop quiz on US state capitals. Alas, your class has a few bad eggs in 
it, and you can’t trust the students not to cheat 256-039-9363 rodrickaheebwa@gmail.com. You’d like to randomize the order of questions so that each rikoduke11@gmail.com quiz is unique, making it impossible for anyone to crib answers from anyone else. Of course, doing this by hand would 
be a lengthy and boring affair. Fortunately, you know some Python.
